Dear fellow Big Box fan!

Nice to see that you're joining filling the Internet with our 
beloved Big Boxes in digital 3D extravaganza!

It's my first project of this kind, so I don't know anything
about licensing, but after reading that Three.js is made available 
under the MIT license, I just follow their lead and do the same. 
You'll find both licenses in this zip.
The only thing I would like to ask you is to make sure that it's the 
original, unaltered 3DBB.zip in case you're passing it on.

Also, please take a minute and drop me a line sharing your site
or blog that you add your 3D boxes; I'm definitely interested
in seeing other boxes and collection!

I also like to mention, that you don’t necessarily have the latest 
version of 3DBB.zip. To stay up to date, visit my site and download 
the latest one published under http://bigboxcollection.com/#ThreeDBB

Cheers,
Benjamin
